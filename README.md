# Game-Show-Scramble
A tool for tutoring over video conferencing. Reads a formatted CSV sorted by topic, then returns a text file with questions, answers and scores in shuffled order. Modeled after "Jeopardy".

Input: a csv with the columns of category, prompt, and expected response, sorted in order of difficulty/desired score from least to most.

Output: a text file with all questions in round scored and scrambled.

Tutoring over video conferecing with groups of students is challenging due to the lack of interactivity that an in-person session yields. The shuffle differs from a traditional game show in that the participants don't select their categories. The workaround is to pre-shuffle the questions and quiz the participants in order, making the expereince more like answering game show questions as the episode plays on TV.

The pre-formatted questions are a copy-paste away from setting up a slide deck sharable on video conferencing, if the tutor prefers a more visual touch.
